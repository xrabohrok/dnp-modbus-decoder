For some reason, I can only push to the master branch.
Any other branch is considered...
error: src refspec BaseTests does not match any.
error: failed to push some refs to 'https://github.com/xrabohrok/dnp-modbus-dec
der.git'

make sure your workflow is something like:
//get on the right branch
git checkout <existing branch>
or
git checkout -b <branch thats about to exist, or exists only on remote>

//get latest updates
git pull <name of remote, probably "origin"> <name of current branch> //to get latest version of that branch

do your work

//save your work at a good place
git add .    //adds files to commit
git add -u   //if there are files that should be removed
git commit -m "Commit message -initials"

//send up commited work to remote
git push <name of remote, probably origin> head

remember that the master branch is stuff that we have given the customer, and
dev is stuff we ourselves have determined to be good and working
you should not be push/pulling from other branches to master or dev
finished feature branches are merged back into dev
finished parts of dev are merged into master upon release
